# Purpose of the Project

1. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the setup and working
   of a private authoritative DNS server using BIND9.

2. The project is designed to show that domain name resolution can be fully
   controlled without depending on public internet DNS servers.

3. Recursion is intentionally disabled to ensure that only the configured
   internal domain is resolved by the DNS server.

4. No web server is configured on purpose to clearly separate DNS functionality
   from web hosting.

5. This setup proves ownership and control of the DNS server, not website
   deployment.

6. The project also demonstrates how internal or private DNS is used in
   organizations to isolate services from the public internet.

7. The behavior where public domains do not resolve is expected and confirms
   correct private DNS configuration.

8. Overall, the project focuses on DNS control, isolation, and security
   rather than application hosting.
